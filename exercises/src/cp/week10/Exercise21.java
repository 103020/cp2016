	- Make it so the user simply needs to invoke a static method, e.g., "count" to start the word counting of an array of strings.
	- count should check if the array is bigger than 10; if so, it should split the array in two and invoke count on these
	two slices in parallel (using an executor).
	- when the two sub-computations are done, collect the results.
	- At the end, output the total count of words.
